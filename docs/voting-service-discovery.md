# Voting Service Discovery

How zodl-ios discovers vote servers and PIR endpoints at runtime. The wallet implements draft [ZIP 1244](https://github.com/zcash/zips/pull/1244) "Shielded Voting Wallet API".

## Resolution order

1. **Local override** — `voting-config-local.json` bundled in the app's main bundle (DEBUG builds only). Intended for local development against a local chain.
2. **CDN** — [`https://valargroup.github.io/token-holder-voting-config/voting-config.json`](https://valargroup.github.io/token-holder-voting-config/voting-config.json), served via GitHub Pages from [`valargroup/token-holder-voting-config`](https://github.com/valargroup/token-holder-voting-config).

There is no silent fallback. If the local override is malformed, or the CDN is unreachable, returns non-200, decodes to an unsupported shape, or advertises a version the wallet doesn't speak, the wallet routes to the `.configError` screen (`VotingConfigErrorView`) and voting is blocked for the session.

Implementation lives in [`VotingAPIClientLiveKey.swift`](../secant/Sources/Dependencies/VotingAPIClient/VotingAPIClientLiveKey.swift) (`fetchServiceConfig`).

## Config format

Per ZIP 1244 §"Vote Configuration Format":

```json
{
  "config_version": 1,
  "vote_round_id": "aabbccddeeff00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff00112233445566778899",
  "vote_servers": [
    {"url": "https://vote-chain-primary.valargroup.org", "label": "primary"},
    {"url": "https://vote-chain-secondary.valargroup.org", "label": "secondary"}
  ],
  "pir_endpoints": [
    {"url": "https://pir.valargroup.org", "label": "PIR primary"}
  ],
  "snapshot_height": 3312900,
  "vote_end_time": 1735689600,
  "proposals": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Approve protocol upgrade",
      "description": "Approve or oppose the proposed protocol upgrade.",
      "options": [
        {"index": 0, "label": "Support"},
        {"index": 1, "label": "Oppose"}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "supported_versions": {
    "pir": ["v0"],
    "vote_protocol": "v0",
    "tally": "v0",
    "vote_server": "v1"
  }
}
```

All fields are required. `JSONDecoder` throws on any missing field, which surfaces as a `.configError` with `VotingConfigError.decodeFailed`.

| Field                | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `config_version`     | Schema version of this document. Currently 1.                                                                                                                               |
| `vote_round_id`      | Lowercase hex (64 chars) id of the voting round this config is published for. Bound to the chain's `VoteRound` via the SHA-256 of `proposals` (see "Proposals hash" below). |
| `vote_servers`       | Chain REST + helper API endpoints. The wallet's first entry serves API traffic; all entries are used for distributing share submissions.                                    |
| `pir_endpoints`      | PIR servers for nullifier-exclusion proofs. The first entry is used.                                                                                                        |
| `snapshot_height`    | Zcash block height the Orchard-pool voting snapshot was taken at.                                                                                                           |
| `vote_end_time`      | Unix timestamp after which votes are no longer accepted.                                                                                                                    |
| `proposals`          | Proposals the user votes on. Each has `id` (1-indexed), `title`, `description`, and `options` (each with `index` and `label`).                                             |
| `supported_versions` | What versions of each component the server speaks. See "Version handling" below.                                                                                            |

## Version handling

[`WalletCapabilities`](../secant/Sources/Dependencies/VotingModels/VotingServiceConfig.swift) declares what this wallet build speaks. On each boot, `validate()` rejects the config if:

- `supported_versions.vote_server ∉ WalletCapabilities.voteServer`
- `supported_versions.vote_protocol ∉ WalletCapabilities.voteProtocol`
- `supported_versions.tally ∉ WalletCapabilities.tally`
- `supported_versions.pir ∩ WalletCapabilities.pir == ∅`

Rejection routes to `.configError`. Per ZIP 1244 §"Version Handling" this is a MUST — the wallet is too old to participate in this round and must be updated.

The `WalletCapabilities` values are compiled into the binary because they are a claim about what the binary actually implements: REST path prefixes in Swift, ZKP circuits in the Rust backend, the PIR scheme version the Rust `pir-client` crate speaks. Moving them to a runtime config would let a wallet accept a config its code can't serve. Bumping a version is a breaking change requiring code updates *and* a bump of `WalletCapabilities`.

## Proposals hash verification

Per ZIP 1244 §"Proposals Hash", the chain's `VoteRound.proposals_hash` is `SHA-256` over the canonical JSON form of the `proposals` array. On `.allRoundsLoaded`, the wallet:

1. Finds the on-chain session matching `config.vote_round_id`.
2. Computes `VotingServiceConfig.computeProposalsHash(config.proposals)`.
3. Compares to the session's `proposalsHash`.

Mismatch routes to `.configError`. This prevents a tampered CDN config from displaying different proposals than what's committed on-chain.

## Round-manifest verification (Phase 2)

After the proposals-hash check, the wallet runs `verifyRoundSignatures(serverEaPK:)` (see [`VotingServiceConfig.swift`](../secant/Sources/Dependencies/VotingModels/VotingServiceConfig.swift)). This authenticates the round's `ea_pk` against ed25519 signatures from operators whose pubkeys are baked into the wallet bundle ([`ManifestTrustAnchor`](../secant/Sources/Dependencies/VotingModels/RoundManifest.swift)).

The verifier hard-fails to `.configError` on any of:

- `manifestSignaturesMissing` — `round_signatures` absent from the CDN config.
- `manifestRoundIdMismatch` — the manifest's `round_id` doesn't match `vote_round_id`.
- `manifestMalformed` — bad base64 / hex / wrong field length.
- `manifestSignatureInvalid` — fewer than `kRequired` distinct signers in `manifest_signers` produced a valid ed25519 signature over the canonical payload.
- `eaPKMismatch` — the server's `ea_pk` for this round disagrees with the manifest's. This branch is what catches a hijacked vote-server returning a different (attacker-controlled) `ea_pk` than the publisher signed off-chain.

The full spec, schema, and threat model live in [`vote-sdk/docs/config.md`](https://github.com/valargroup/vote-sdk/blob/main/docs/config.md). The reference signer CLI is [`vote-sdk/cmd/manifest-signer`](https://github.com/valargroup/vote-sdk/tree/main/cmd/manifest-signer); the operator-side runbook is [`sign-round-manifest.md`](https://github.com/valargroup/vote-sdk/blob/main/docs/runbooks/sign-round-manifest.md).

**Canonical form:** proposals sorted by `id` ascending, options by `index` ascending, no whitespace, keys emitted in order `id`, `title`, `description`, `options` (and `index`, `label` per option), UTF-8. The Swift implementation uses `JSONEncoder` with `.withoutEscapingSlashes` to match Rust `serde_json::to_string` byte output (verified byte-identical across `/`, U+2028/U+2029, control characters, CJK, emoji). See [`VotingServiceConfig.canonicalProposalsJSON`](../secant/Sources/Dependencies/VotingModels/VotingServiceConfig.swift) and the pinned-hash regression tests in [`VotingServiceConfigTests.swift`](../secantTests/VotingTests/VotingServiceConfigTests.swift).

## Failure recovery

- **Transient failure during a round transition** (CDN mid-deploy, cached config now stale): `.allRoundsLoaded` silently auto-retries one fetch per staleness window before surfacing an error. The flag gating the retry resets on every successful binding and on `.initialize`, so each round transition gets its own retry allotment.
- **Permanent failure** (unsupported version, tampered proposals, round-id mismatch after retry): terminal for the voting session. The user dismisses and re-enters once they've updated the wallet or the publisher has corrected the CDN.

## Publisher responsibilities

The config publisher (currently [`valargroup/token-holder-voting-config`](https://github.com/valargroup/token-holder-voting-config)) must:

1. Update `vote_round_id`, `vote_end_time`, `snapshot_height`, and `proposals` at or before each on-chain round activates. Any window where the CDN is behind the chain causes transient `.configError`s for wallets booted during that window (auto-retry covers most cases, but the publisher pipeline should be fast).
2. Ensure `proposals` exactly matches the chain's `VoteRound.proposals` for `vote_round_id`. Any divergence produces a `proposalsHashMismatch` for every voter.
3. Keep `supported_versions.vote_server` aligned with the REST path prefix the deployed server actually serves (the wallet hits `/shielded-vote/v1/` when `vote_server: "v1"`).

When no round is active, `vote_round_id` may be `"0" * 64` and `proposals` may be empty as placeholders; wallets correctly skip the binding check when the chain also has no rounds.
